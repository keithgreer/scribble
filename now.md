## What I'm doing now

### Ecommerce
* Building bigger and better things with [Magento](https://magento.com/products/magento-open-source) 2. 
* Supporting and maintaining legacy Magento 1 sites.
* Finding new technologies and methodologies. 

### Content Managment 
* Getting used to Jekyll for deploying static websites. I recently moved my [Dad's website](https://williejohngreer.co.uk) over. 

### Development
* Using Linux ([Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/)) as my day-to-day operating system - a move away from Windows 10. 
* On the look out for new technologies and moving away from Ecommerce. 
* Is there an open source PHP content managent system to replace WordPress? 
* Making websites faster
