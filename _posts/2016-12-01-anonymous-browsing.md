    In the United Kingdom the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigatory_Powers_Act_2016">Investigatory Powers Act</a> has been signed into law by HM The Queen. The powers grant the Government new surveillance powers including rules that force internet providers to keep complete records of every website that all of their customers visit.

## Browsing the web

The Tor Browser is one of the best known anonymous browsing tools out there. It is often described as a &#8216;censorship circumvention tool&#8217;. It is a free network of servers, or ‘nodes’, that randomly route Internet traffic between each other in order to obfuscate the origin of the data. The Tor Browser can significantly increase a user’s privacy and anonymity online. In internal documents, the NSA even refers to Tor as &#8220;the king of high-secure, low latency Internet Anonymity.&#8221;

## Messaging

Many messaging platforms already provied end-to-end encrypted messaging. This includes WhatsApp and iMessage. Signal is a messaging app designed so they themselves cannot read your messages, and no one else can either. Everything is always end-to-end encrypted and painstakingly engineered in order to keep your communication safe.
