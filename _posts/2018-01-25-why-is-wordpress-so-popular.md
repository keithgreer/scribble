WordPress is a free and open source software used by millions of people around the world to create websites and blogs. The most popular features of WordPress include its ease of use and ability to be extended way beyond the simple blog software it starts out as.

Front-end themes and templates can be easily downloaded from the official WordPress site or from hundreds of other places around the web. The same goes with extensions and plugins, which are used to extend the functionality of your WordPress site. A wide range of people contribute time, knowledge and skill to keeping the core WordPress software updated and secure.

There’s also a huge number of designers, developers & bloggers who share their knowledge through blog posts, tutorials, reviews, videos and the creation of thousands of themes & plugins.

It is estimated that WordPress could power as much as 29% of the world wide web. It is used for everything from personal blogs to large corporate websites with an even wider range of uses. From news sites and magazines to full e-commerce and online booking systems.
