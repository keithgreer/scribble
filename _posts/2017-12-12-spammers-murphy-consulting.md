You&#8217;ll have picked up from previous posts, I really don&#8217;t like spam. Running a website with a contact form I get a fair bit but occasionally I get spammed by what otherwise looks to be a reputable company and I have to call them out on it.

At <a href="http://www.murphyconsulting.us" rel="nofollow">Murphy Consulting</a> (www.murphyconsulting.us) their number one goal is to create a mutually beneficial relationship with their partner, keep them happy and earn repeat business.

The spamming itself has been outsourced to the Philippines. Which itself is worrying for anyone taking-up Murphy Consulting as a web designer/developer or SEO agency. [Brian Murphy](https://cleantalk.org/blacklists/brian@murphyconsulting.us) at Murphy Consulting is already well known as a spammer. They are also known for ignoring SPAM warnings and violating terms of use of websites  [like this example](http://www.consumerblitz.com/4794/msg-letter-of-introduction/). 

If their own marketing capabilities are anything to go by they are best avoided.

I tried contacting Murphy Consulting via their Facebook and the Twitter account of another company that shares their office. Patrick Murphy and Brian Murphy are yet to respond to requests for help.

No response this far.
