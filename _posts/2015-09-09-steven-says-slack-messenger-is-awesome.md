My collegue Steven Cotterill at The Tomorrow Lab has outlined just how useful a messenger app can be in a development environment.

> At the beginning of the year we here at the Tomorrow Lab brought a new program into the office called <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>. Upon first use I didn’t see what the <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/02/12/slack-growth/" target="_blank">big deal</a> was, brushing it off as just another chat-room type program. However, over the following months it would become an integral part of our team which is used daily and always opened on our computers.
