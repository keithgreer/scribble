I can get access to better internet in rural Mid Ulster (a townland called Tyanee just across the River Bann from the town of Portglenone) than on the Crumlin Road in North Belfast. How is that possible?

**Tyanee** (just across the River Bann from the town of Portglenone in the middle of nowhere)

Phone numbers blanked because you all don&#8217;t need to know my land line numbers.
