Free and open source web application security test tools.

**[Burp Suite](http://www.portswigger.net)
  
** Free and commercial tool. Excellent adjunct to manual testing and has a good scanner capability as well. Of professional web application testers I know, most use this.

**[W3af.orh](http://w3af.org/)**
  
Open source scanning tool, seems to be developing quite a bit at the moment, primarily focuses on the automated scanning side of things, is still requires quite a bit of knowledge to use effectively.
