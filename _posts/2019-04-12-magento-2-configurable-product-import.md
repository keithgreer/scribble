Magento 2 allows configurable products to be imported through the CMS. 

Unlike Magento 1 where [Magmi](https://github.com/dweeves/magmi-git) generally did all the hard work when it came to importing and updating Configurable Products the built-in system in M2 allows you do do it without any additional plugins/code. 

The folks at Lexiconn seem to have cracked it: [Magento 2 â€“ Import Configurable Products](https://www.lexiconn.com/blog/2016/01/magento-2-import-configurable-products/)

Be sure that before you begin looking at your CSV that all the prerequisites have been put in place - setting up the attributes, attribute sets and categories.
