As a PHP developers most of my time is spent working with Linux servers. When Microsoft introduced the [Linux Sub-system for Windows](https://keithgreer.uk/running-ubuntu-windows) I jumped at the chance to use the same server commands I was used to locally on my Windows PC.

Over time I realised that the majority of the software I was using (PhpStorm, MySQL Workbench, GIT, Keepass were all available on Linux.

I decided to make the switch from Windows 10 for Linux.

**Ubuntu MATE**

With many, many, many distributions to choose from, I picked Ubuntu MATE for two reasons. First it is a official derivative of [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu) itself which is an extremely popular Linux distribution. Well supported and maintained and it includes the [Debian .deb package format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dpkg), which is important if you don&#8217;t really know what you&#8217;re doing when it comes to installing software.

Secondly Ubuntu MATE comes with the [MATE desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATE_(software)). Standard Ubuntu switched to the Unity desktop environment and then GNOME Shell. While Unity and GNOME Shell both do the trick they were both too different from the Windows-style taskbar and Start button I&#8217;m accustomed too.

Ubuntu MATE offered both the stable environment and the traditional Window-like desktop environment I was looking for.

**Download + InstallÂ **

Download the appropriate version of Ubuntu MATE for your PC. 64-bit is the standard version and most likely the one you should down. Unless you&#8217;re running a very old machine which will require 32-bit, or you&#8217;ve got specialized hardware like a Raspberry Pi.
