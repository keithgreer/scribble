I&#8217;ve been getting spammed by a company called The Compensation Specialist. They are a personal injury outfit. I&#8217;m not sure how they got my email but I didn&#8217;t subscribe and we don&#8217;t have an existing relationship, both are required for a UK company to send [unsolicited email marketing material](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/electronic-and-telephone-marketing/electronic-mail-marketing/).

> The rules on electronic mail marketing are in regulation 22. In short, you must not send electronic mail marketing to individuals, unless:
> 
>   * they have specifically consented to electronic mail from you; or
>   * they are an existing customer who bought (or negotiated to buy) a similar product or service from you in the past, and you gave them a simple way to opt out both when you first collected their details and in every message you have sent.
> 
> You must not disguise or conceal your identity, and you must provide a valid contact address so they can opt out or unsubscribe.

I can&#8217;t seem to find any online or email contact details so might have to send this post out to him at his registered address.

Edit: Found an email address for one of Lee&#8217;s other companies, I&#8217;ll email there to find out wasssup.

The link in the spam email directs through to a contact form, which handily includes Mr Meranda&#8217;s companies record with the Crisis Management Regulator.

The Claims Regular provides an outline of Lee&#8217;s organisations. I&#8217;ll see if I can contact him through one of those.
