Google is set to add a new Security Panel to the Chrome browser to help developers visualise and
  
troubleshoot network connections. 

The security panel provides developers with connection information for every request. Allowing them to see what connection errors are getting in the way of the glorious green lock that represents a secure connection. It will show the status of the TLS certificate verification and highlight any insecure HTTP resources. 

Google has been pushing to make HTTPS the standard way users browse the internet. Even this site &#8211; with no private or personal data stored/shared is provided over a secure connection because it&#8217;s what Google prefers these days. 

Still in the beta build the new feature has made it into Chromium. Google says it will begin to update browsers with the new features in the coming days.
