This site is now running on Github Pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). 

Where WordPress was a content management system Jekyll is a static site generator. It reads content in the form of .md (markdown) files and templates in the form of .html files and churns out a complete static website. 

I'm still getting the hang of it.

#### Development

While working locally test changse using 

<pre>bundle exec jekyll serve</pre>

The site can be viewed on [http://127.0.0.1:4000/

#### Production

To push to the live Github Pages site 

<pre>$ bundle exec jekyll build

$ git add -A

$ git commit -m "Message"

$ git push</pre>
