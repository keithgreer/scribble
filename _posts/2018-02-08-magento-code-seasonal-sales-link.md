A lot of sites have a seasonal sale which needs turned on and promoted at different times during the year .

This code takes the ID of a sale category and checks if the category is active.

If the cateogry is active it will print a link to the category whos URL is regulary updated to whatever type of sale is on &#8220;/winter-sale&#8221;, &#8220;/season-sale&#8221; etc.
