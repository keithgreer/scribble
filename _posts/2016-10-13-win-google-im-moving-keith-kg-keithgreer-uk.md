Google&#8217;s automatic identification of a website&#8217;s intended audience using the top level domains means my .kg domain name has been slowly sliding down the rankings in Google. 

I&#8217;ve finally bit the bullet and gone to a more standard .uk domain name. Should say [.eu](https://keithgreer.eu), [.ie](https://keithgreer.ie/) and [.co.uk](https://keithgreer.co.uk/) were also available but I weighed the odds and went for the more modern .uk with 301s all over the show. I&#8217;ve also taken the opportunity to move hosting from Blacknight to [Spiral Hosting](https://www.spiralhosting.com/). 

I would like to thank my domain providers from the great and glorious [ ![KG](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Flag_of_Kyrgyzstan.svg/23px-Flag_of_Kyrgyzstan.svg.png)Kyrgyz Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan). Their odd little top level domain was a pleasure to use, but it is time to go home. 

It was good while it lasted.
