You have only a few seconds to make a strong initial impact to prospective customers on the internet. It is then necessary that the site lives up to the initial impression and performs well, is logically laid out and easy to use.

## Web Design Northern Ireland

I have experience using a wide variety of web development languages including HTML5+CSS, PHP+MySQL and JavaScript. I have also worked with popular content management systems such as Magento, WordPress, Moodle and others. I create concise, modern, standards-compliant code for websites, with a clear relationship to the website and its purpose and have a progressive approach to the technology used and of the future aspects of the website that need to be considered.

I create fully accessible, attractable and affordable websites throughout Ireland making use of a range of software application including Microsoft FrontPage, Microsoft Expression Web, Dreamweaver, Flash or basic text program and FTP applications.

## Website Accessibility

All my web design projects are aim to be fully compliant to W3C specifications and guidelines including XHTML, XML, CSS and WAI.
