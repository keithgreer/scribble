Web Services, getting and keeping your website online and working for you.

## Hosting

Hosting is where you keep your website on the internet. I am not tied to any one specific web host, and so can give you experienced, impartial advice as to where to keep your website and which packages best suit your needs.

## Domains

Your domain is how your customer will find your website online. Website addresses are often included with web hosting packages. A domain is the www dot something dot com bit of your website.

## Search Engine Optimisation

Search engines are one of the primary ways that Internet users find websites. That’s why a Web site with good search engine listings may see a dramatic increase in traffic.

Everyone wants those good listings. Unfortunately, many Web sites appear poorly in search engine rankings or may not be listed at all because they fail to consider how search engines work. In particular, submitting to search engines (as covered in the Essentials section) is only part of the challenge of getting good search engine positioning. It’s also important to prepare a Web site through SEO – search engine optimisation.

Search engine optimization means ensuring that your Web pages are accessible to search engines and are focused in ways that help improve the chances they will be found.

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a powerful tool for monitoring all aspects of your websites traffic, from referrals to search engine activity. Like any application designed to do so much, Google Analytics comes with a rather steep learning curve, which can be intimidating at first. However, by familiarising yourself with the program, using the tool can become second nature.

## Social Networking?

Social networking websites offer different ways to communicate via the Internet. Sites allow people to easily and simply create their own online page or profile and to construct and display an online network of contacts, often called friends. Users are able to build a network of connections that they can display as a list of friends. These friends may be offline actual friends or acquaintances, or people they know or have met only online, and with whom they have no other link. Social networking sites are not limited to messaging, communicating and displaying networks. Nearly all sites allow users to post photos, video and often music on their profiles and share them with others.
