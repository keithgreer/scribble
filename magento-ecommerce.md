I can help you harness the outstanding functionality of Magento and developing robust websites that deliver elegant, scalable solutions, no matter how complex your websites requirements.

#### Zend Framework

Magento is built on the Zend Framework. Zend is an open source framework for developing web applications and services. Zend Framework 2 uses object-oriented code and utilises most of the new features of PHP 5.3, namely namespaces, late static binding, lambda functions and closures. This ensures that the platform is safe and scalable. The Zend Framework provides an object-oriented library of code and a reliable organization behind this code.

#### Magento Integration

One of the strengths of Magento is its ability to build on the extensive body of existing modules. This might not always be enough or possible in all situations. When you have to integrate with a proprietary or internal system bespoke Magento development might be required.
