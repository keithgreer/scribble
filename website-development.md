I offer website development based on a clear information structure that easily engages with your customers or members. I have development experience using the most widely used programming languages on the internet including Apache HTTP server, PHP scripting, XML rendering and MySQL databases.

## Website Development

All sites can be bespoke website developments designed and built to suit your business needs and style. I can test and refine your website’s functionality and usability so that they work smoothly and perfectly for your customers. I can help you decide what it is you need to get your company or organisation online and working for your customers and members.

Web development has come to mean the creation of content management systems or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source . In broad terms the CMS acts your gateway between the database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS is that it allows you people to make changes to your Web site without having technical knowledge. Once everything is set-up, it’s over to you!

Website development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
